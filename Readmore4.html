								<center>The Tagbanua traditionally practice swidden agriculture, hunting, and fishing, and they have developed a deep knowledge of the environment that allows them to sustainably manage their resources. They have a strong spiritual connection to the land and sea, which is reflected in their beliefs and rituals.

	                             One of the most important Tagbanua ceremonies is the Pagdiwata, which is a thanksgiving ritual that honors the spirits of the ancestors and the natural world. This ceremony involves offerings of food, prayers, and traditional music and dance.</center>

								<center>One of the most important festivals in Cuyo is the Semana Santa or Holy Week, which is celebrated with colorful processions, traditional rituals, and religious ceremonies.
