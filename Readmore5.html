								<center>Batanes is a group of islands located in the northernmost part of the Philippines, bordered by the Luzon Strait to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The islands are known for their stunning landscapes, rugged coastlines, and unique culture.

								The Ivatan people, the native inhabitants of Batanes, have a distinct culture and way of life that sets them apart from the rest of the Philippines. They have a strong sense of community, and their traditional houses, called "vakul", are made of cogon grass and serve as protection from the harsh weather conditions of the region.</center>
