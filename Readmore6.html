								<center>Bohol is an island province located in the Central Visayas region of the Philippines. The culture of Bohol is a blend of indigenous traditions, Spanish colonial influences, and modern Filipino culture.

								One of the most prominent cultural attractions in Bohol is the Chocolate Hills, a geological formation of more than 1,200 hills that turn brown during the dry season, resembling chocolate mounds. The hills are considered a national geological monument and are a popular tourist destination in the province.

								The indigenous people of Bohol are known as the Boholanos. They have a rich culture that is heavily influenced by their relationship with the natural environment. Many of their cultural traditions revolve around agriculture and fishing, which are still an essential part of the local economy.
