								<center>The culture of Vigan is heavily influenced by its Spanish colonial past and the indigenous traditions of the Ilocano people. The city's architecture features a mix of Spanish and Asian styles, including wooden houses with red-tiled roofs, cobblestone streets, and colonial-era buildings such as the St. Paul Metropolitan Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace.

								Vigan is also known for its culinary tradition, which is a blend of indigenous, Chinese, and Spanish influences. Some of the popular dishes in Vigan include "bagnet," which is deep-fried pork belly, "longganisa," which is a type of Filipino sausage, and "empanada," which is a pastry filled with meat and vegetables.</center>

								<center>One of the most significant aspects of Vigan's culture is its architecture. The city has retained much of its colonial-era architecture, including the cobblestone streets, old houses, and public buildings that date back to the Spanish colonial period. These structures feature a unique blend of Spanish and Asian styles, including traditional wooden houses with red-tiled roofs and the baroque-style St. Paul Metropolitan Cathedral.</center>
